*Chat Application Using Spring Boot and WebSocket* ✨

This is a simple real-time chat application built with Spring Boot and WebSocket. It allows users to join a chat room, send messages, and see updates when other users join or leave.

- About
This project is my first hands-on experience in my journey as a Backend Intern at Trendyol. It's a foundational project to explore backend technologies, WebSocket communication, and real-time systems. ✨

- Features
  - Real-time messaging using WebSocket.
  - User joins and leaves are broadcasted to all connected users.
  - Lightweight frontend for interacting with the chat server.
  - Separation of frontend and backend logic.


- Technologies Used
  - Spring Boot: Backend framework to build REST APIs and WebSocket support.
  - WebSocket: Protocol for real-time, two-way communication.
  - SockJS: Fallback for browsers that don't support WebSocket.
  - Stomp.js: Simplifies messaging over WebSocket.
  - HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Basic frontend to interact with the backend.
